# myRISC-Multicycle-Procesor
myRISC is a educational processor based in the MIPS architecture. It has a reduced number of supported instructions (R, I and J instructions) with each one being a 4 bytes word. There are 32 registers in myRISC.

This is a multicycle version of myRISC, also called myRISC v2, which follows the Harvard Architecture. The following instructions are supported: LW and SW, R-Type, BEQ, ADDI and J. The hardware components are managed by a finite state machine acting as a control unit.

The processor can be simulated via EdaPlayground.
